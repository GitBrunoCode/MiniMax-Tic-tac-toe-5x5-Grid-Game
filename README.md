## Introduction


The main objective of this project was to create a program capable of playing a tic tac toe game on 5*5 grid versus a human player. Unlike tic tac toe, the player objective is to obtain a 4 symboles row with his own symbol instead of 3. The AI behind the computer player is based on a MiniMax algorithm, optimized with Zobrist Hashing and alpha beta pruning. Obviously, the MiniMax algorithm is based on a Evaluation function which could be clearly optimized to increase the difficulty of the game.
